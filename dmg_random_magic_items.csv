Potion Miscibility
d100 	Result
01 	The mixture creates a magical explosion, dealing 6d10 force damage to the mixer and 1d10 force damage to each creature within 5 feet of the mixer.
02–08 	The mixture becomes an ingested poison of the DM’s choice.
09–15 	Both potions lose their effects.
16–25 	One potion loses its effect.
26–35 	Both potions work, but with their numerical effects and durations halved. A potion has no effect if it can’t be halved in this way.
36–90 	Both potions work normally.
91–99 	The numerical effects and duration of one potion are doubled. If neither potion has anything to double in this way, they work normally.
00 	Only one potion works, but its effect is permanent. Choose the simplest effect to make permanent, or the one that seems the most fun. For example, a potion of healing might increase the drinker’s hit point maximum by 4, or oil of etherealness might permanently trap the user in the Ethereal Plane. At your discretion, an appropriate spell, such as dispel magic or remove curse, might end this lasting effect.

Scroll Mishap
d6 	Result
1 	A surge of magical energy deals the caster 1d6 force damage per level of the spell.
2 	The spell affects the caster or an ally (determined randomly) instead of the intended target, or it affects a random target nearby if the caster was the intended target.
3 	The spell affects a random location within the spell’s range.
4 	The spell’s effect is contrary to its normal one, but neither harmful nor beneficial. For instance, a fireball might produce an area of harmless cold.
5 	The caster suffers a minor but bizarre effect related to the spell. Such effects last only as long as the original spell’s duration, or 1d10 minutes for spells that take effect instantaneously. For example, a fireball might cause smoke to billow from the caster’s ears for 1d10 minutes.
6 	The spell activates after 1d12 hours. If the caster was the intended target, the spell takes effect normally. If the caster was not the intended target, the spell goes off in the general direction of the intended target, up to the spell’s maximum range, if the target has moved away.

Magic Item - Who Created It or Was Intended to Use It?
d20 	Creator or Intended User
1 	Aberration. The item was created by aberrations in ancient times, possibly for the use of favored humanoid thralls. When seen from the corner of the eye, the item seems to be moving.
2–4 	Human. The item was created during the heyday of a fallen human kingdom, or it is tied to a human of legend. It might hold writing in a forgotten tongue or symbols whose significance is lost to the ages.
5 	Celestial. The weapon is half the normal weight and inscribed with feathered wings, suns, and other symbols of good. Fiends find the item’s presence repulsive.
6 	Dragon. This item is made from scales and talons shed by a dragon. Perhaps it incorporates precious metals and gems from the dragon’s hoard. It grows slightly warm when within 120 feet of a dragon.
7 	Drow. The item is half the normal weight. It is black and inscribed with spiders and webs in honor of Lolth. It might function poorly, or disintegrate, if exposed to sunlight for 1 minute or more.
8–9 	Dwarf. The item is durable and has Dwarven runes worked into its design. It might be associated with a clan that would like to see it returned to their ancestral halls.
10 	Elemental Air. The item is half the normal weight and feels hollow. If it’s made of fabric, it is diaphanous.
11 	Elemental Earth. This item might be crafted from stone. Any cloth or leather elements are studded with finely polished rock.
12 	Elemental Fire. This item is warm to the touch, and any metal parts are crafted from black iron. Sigils of flames cover its surface. Shades of red and orange are the prominent colors.
13 	Elemental Water. Lustrous fish scales replace leather or cloth on this item, and metal portions are instead crafted from seashells and worked coral as hard as any metal.
14–15 	Elf. The item is half the normal weight. It is adorned with symbols of nature: leaves, vines, stars, and the like.
16 	Fey. The item is exquisitely crafted from the finest materials and glows with a pale radiance in moonlight, shedding dim light in a 5-foot radius. Any metal in the item is silver or mithral, rather than iron or steel.
17 	Fiend. The item is made of black iron or horn inscribed with runes, and any cloth or leather components are crafted from the hide of fiends. It is warm to the touch and features leering faces or vile runes engraved on its surface. Celestials find the item’s presence repulsive.
18 	Giant. The item is larger than normal and was crafted by giants for use by their smaller allies.
19 	Gnome. The item is crafted to appear ordinary, and it might look worn. It could also incorporate gears and mechanical components, even if these aren’t essential to the item’s function.
20 	Undead. The item incorporates imagery of death, such as bones and skulls, and it might be crafted from parts of corpses. It feels cold to the touch.
Magic Item - What Is a Detail from Its History?
d8 	History
1 	Arcane. This item was created for an ancient order of spellcasters and bears the order’s symbol.

5 	Prophecy. The item features in a prophecy: its bearer is destined to play a key role in future events. Someone else who wants to play that role might try to steal the item, or someone who wants to prevent the prophecy from being fulfilled might try to kill the item’s bearer.
6 	Religious. This item was used in religious ceremonies dedicated to a particular deity. It has holy symbols worked into it. The god’s followers might try to persuade its owner to donate it to a temple, steal the item for themselves, or celebrate its use by a cleric or paladin of the same deity.

Magic Item - What Minor Property Does It Have?
d20 	Minor Property
1 	Beacon. The bearer can use a bonus action to cause the item to shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet, or to extinguish the light.
2 	Compass. The wielder can use an action to learn which way is north.
3 	Conscientious. When the bearer of this item contemplates or undertakes a malevolent act, the item enhances pangs of conscience.

5 	Gleaming. This item never gets dirty.
6 	Guardian. The item whispers warnings to its bearer, granting a +2 bonus to initiative if the bearer isn’t incapacitated.
7 	Harmonious. Attuning to this item takes only 1 minute.
8 	Hidden Message. A message is hidden somewhere on the item. It might be visible only at a certain time of the year, under the light of one phase of the moon, or in a specific location.
9 	Key. The item is used to unlock a container, chamber, vault, or other entryway.
10 	Language. The bearer can speak and understand a language of the DM’s choice while the item is on the bearer’s person.
11 	Sentinel. Choose a kind of creature that is an enemy of the item’s creator. This item glows faintly when such creatures are within 120 feet of it.

17 	Waterborne. This item floats on water and other liquids. Its bearer has advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks to swim.
18 	Wicked. When the bearer is presented with an opportunity to act in a selfish or malevolent way, the item heightens the bearer’s urge to do so.
19 	Illusion. The item is imbued with illusion magic, allowing its bearer to alter the item’s appearance in minor ways. Such alterations don’t change how the item is worn, carried, or wielded, and they have no effect on its other magical properties. For example, the wearer could make a red robe appear blue, or make a gold ring look like it’s made of ivory. The item reverts to its true appearance when no one is carrying or wearing it.
20 	Roll twice, rerolling any additional 20s.
Magic Item - What Quirk Does It Have?
d12 	Quirk

2 	Confident. The item helps its bearer feel self-assured.
3 	Covetous. The item’s bearer becomes obsessed with material wealth.
4 	Frail. The item crumbles, frays, chips, or cracks slightly when wielded, worn, or activated. This quirk has no effect on its properties, but if the item has seen much use, it looks decrepit.
5 	Hungry. This item’s magical properties function only if fresh blood from a humanoid has been applied to it within the past 24 hours. It needs only a drop to activate.
6 	Loud. The item makes a loud noise—such as a clang, a shout, or a resonating gong—when used.
7 	Metamorphic. The item periodically and randomly alters its appearance in slight ways. The bearer has no control over these minor alterations, which have no effect on the item’s use.

9 	Painful. The bearer experiences a harmless flash of pain when using the item.

11 	Repulsive. The bearer feels a sense of distaste when in contact with the item, and continues to sense discomfort while bearing it.
12 	Slothful. The bearer of this item feels slothful and lethargic. While attuned to the item, the bearer requires 10 hours to finish a long rest.
